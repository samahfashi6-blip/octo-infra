Hi Team,

I've successfully forced the update for the curriculum-service.

I verified the logs and confirmed that:
*   The service started with `PUBSUB_ENABLED=false`.
*   The CIE API client initialized successfully.

The service is now running the latest Phase 2 revision.

Best,
Curriculum Service Team
